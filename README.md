# RaceAnnouncerBot
## General Idea

This bot came into being because during races of especially Pok√©mon Red it becomes hard to keep track where all racers are. Some viewers started to post updates in all racers twitch chats manually, but that becomes tedious quickly.

As livesplit gathers that data anyways, this project was started to properly gather the data livesplit provides and update all racers chats as needed.

## Goals for the future

Currently the biggest thing going on is to add game specific split aliases to remove the need for **exactly** standardized split names. Also gathering of data like segment times etc. to provide some basic statistics
